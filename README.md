# Interoperability Laboratory Of Laboratories (iLoLs)
This is a shared space for the members of the laboratory network. We belive that together we can curate, share and advance health technologies with a focus on low resrouce settings. We look to better understand how to facilitate interoperability between systems. We aim to be a lighthouse for projects and team to look to for examples of viable health artefacts (sofware and practises) to support digital health interventions.
